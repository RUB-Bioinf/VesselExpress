# This file is autogenerated by pip-reqs
# Install them using 
# pip3 install pipreqs
# Inside the repo run
#    pipreqs . # creates a requirement.txt file for the given module inside the repo
# Might not list all the dependencies/versions exactly on your machine, in such case use pip3 freeze and try to figure out versions
# I usually let pipreqs figure out first and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt to figure out if any incorrect dependencies are listed, then run tests locally to figure out missing dependencies.
# for packages you are using the module written inside the repo
