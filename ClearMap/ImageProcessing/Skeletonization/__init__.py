Skeletonization
===============

This sub-package provides skeletonization routines for 3d image data of
TB size. At time of implementation it is one of the fastest existing 
implementations and highly optimized for large data sets.

The algorithm is based on discrete topology and binary thinning and
described in more detail in 
:mod:`~ClearMap.ImageProcessing.Skeletonization.Skeletonization`.
