# **Automated Light Sheet Brain Vessel Skeletonization**
This repository is based on the 
[3scan-skeleton repository](https://github.com/3Scan/3scan-skeleton#3d-image-skeletonization-tools) 
containing 3D image skeletonization tools.
It is downloaded from GitHub and further developed with modified and new statistic calculations for 
light sheet brain vessel images.
Many thanks to GitHub and the contributors of the 3scan-skeleton repository!
