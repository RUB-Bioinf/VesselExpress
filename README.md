# **Automated Analysis of 3D Light Sheet Brain Vessel Images**
This repository contains the following implementations for extracting features of 3D vessel images:

1. Segmentation (in progress)
2. Skeleton Extraction
3. Network Graph Retrieval
4. Statistic Calculation

For the skeleton extraction and the network graph retrieval the implementation of the
[3scan-skeleton repository](https://github.com/3Scan/3scan-skeleton#3d-image-skeletonization-tools) is used. 
The skeleton folder is downloaded from GitHub and copied into this repository. Many thanks to GitHub and the contributors of the 3scan-skeleton repository!
