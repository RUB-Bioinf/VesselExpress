segmentation:
*frangi: use vmtk-3D-Frangi-Filter
*frangi2D: use 2D-Frangi-Filter
*franginet: use franginet
*franginet_gpu: use franginet with graphical units

franginet -> mode_img:
*OneCube: automated mask is generated and image is rotated in all three dimensions at once
*OneCubeBatch,: same as OneCube but uses batches instead of whole image
*Default: image is processed slice by slice without rotation

franginet -> mode:
must be the same as the mode for training the model (vanilla or guided)

franginet -> average:
*only if OneCube or OneCubeBatch is chosen and image is rotated
*false: take the maximum
*true: calculate the average of the three dimensions

threshold -> value
*if set to 0, Li-thresholding-algorithm is used
*thresholds are stored in the corresponding thesholds.csv, arranged by f1-score

graphAnalysis -> pixel_dimension
*the order of dimensions is z, y, x
